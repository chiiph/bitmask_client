Soledad -- Synchronization Of Locally Encrypted Data Among Devices
==================================================================

This software is under development.

Dependencies
------------

Soledad depends on the following python libraries:

  * u1db 0.1.4 [1]
  * python-gnupg 0.3.1 [2]
  * CouchDB 0.8 [3]
  * hmac 20101005 [4]
  * pysqlcipher [5]

[1] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/u1db/0.1.4
[2] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gnupg/0.3.1
[3] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CouchDB/0.8
[4] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hmac/20101005
[5] Instructions for downloading and installing are below.

pysqlcipher
-----------

Pysqlcipher is an experimental fork of pysqlite, and is statically linked
against sqlcipher.

To install it, do the following:

  git clone git://git.futeisha.org/pysqlcipher.git
  cd pysqlcipher
  python setup.py install


Tests
-----

Soledad's tests should be run with nose2, like this:

  nose2 leap.soledad.tests

Right now, there are 3 conditions that have to be met for all Soledad tests to
pass without problems:

  1. Use nose2.
  2. Have an http CouchDB instance running on `localhost:5984`.
  3. Have sqlcipher configured (using LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_CONFIG to point
     to the place where libsqlite3.so.0 is located).
